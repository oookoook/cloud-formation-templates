# Cloud Formation Templates

Prepared complex cloud formation templates for AWS hosted apps.

The repo is synced with the [public S3 bucket](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/akucera-cf-templates/) so the templaten can be called from Cloud Formation directly without the need to upload them.

Different sub-folders of the repo (and the bucket) contain versions specific to a particular project.
